# Guesser-Game-Project
The Guesser Game is an engaging Java-based console application designed to illustrate the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in a fun and interactive way. The game revolves around three main roles: Guesser, Players, and Umpire, each represented by separate classes to promote encapsulation and modularity.
